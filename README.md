# JavaScript Basics ‚Äì Revision Notes

This README contains quick notes and examples for the JavaScript topics I practiced today.

---

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

### 1. `console.log()`
Used to print messages to the browser console. Helpful for debugging and testing code.

```js
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
````

---

### 2. `document.getElementById().textContent`

Used to access and update the text content of an HTML element with a specific `id`.

```html
<p id="greet">Old text</p>

<script>
  document.getElementById("greet").textContent = "New text from JS";
</script>
```

### 3. Variables in JavaScript

Variables are containers for storing data. Use `let`, `const`, or `var`.

```js
let userName = "Tarun";   // Block-scoped
const degree = "MCA";     // Cannot be reassigned
var age = 25;             // Function-scoped
```

---

### 4. `typeof` Operator

Used to check the data type of a variable.

```js
let phoneNo = 797264;
console.log(typeof phoneNo); // number
```
